# Helper for running tests under Xcode's XCTest / XCUIAutomation framework

Using XCTest outside Xcode requires quite a bit of setup. The `run_xc_test` script is provided as an example of how you might go about doing this.

Run with e.g.:

```
cargo run --bin run_xc_test -- default_xcode_game ui_test
```
