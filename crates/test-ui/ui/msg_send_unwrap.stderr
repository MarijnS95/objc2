error[E0282]: type annotations needed
 --> ui/msg_send_unwrap.rs
  |
  |     let _: Retained<NSObject> = unsafe { msg_send![cls, new].unwrap() };
  |                                          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer type
  |
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__msg_send_parse` which comes from the expansion of the macro `msg_send` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
