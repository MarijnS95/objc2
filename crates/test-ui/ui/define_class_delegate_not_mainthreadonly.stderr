  = note: expected trait object `dyn MainThreadOnly`
             found trait object `(dyn AllocAnyThread + 'static)`
  = help: `(dyn AllocAnyThread + 'static)` implements `MainThreadOnly` so you could box the found value and coerce it to the trait object `Box<dyn MainThreadOnly>`, you will have to change the expected type as well
  = note: required for `CustomObject` to implement `MainThreadOnly`
