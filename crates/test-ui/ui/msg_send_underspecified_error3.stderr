  = note: multiple `impl`s satisfying `MethodFamily<6>: MsgSendError<&NSObject, _>` found in the `objc2` crate:
          - impl<Receiver, MethodFamily> MsgSendError<Receiver, ()> for MethodFamily
            where MethodFamily: MsgSend<Receiver, bool>;
          - impl<Receiver, Return, MethodFamily> MsgSendError<Receiver, Retained<Return>> for MethodFamily
            where MethodFamily: MsgSend<Receiver, Option<Retained<Return>>>;
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__msg_send_helper` which comes from the expansion of the macro `msg_send` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
